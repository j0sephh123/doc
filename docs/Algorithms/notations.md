# Big-O

## O(1)
No matter how much the input size grows, the time complexity is always the same
- access array index
- add to array start/end
- insert in hashmap
- lookup in hashmap
- remove in hashmap

## O(n)
as input size grows, the time is going to grow proportionally 
- sum of array values
- insert/remove from the middle of the array
- search

## O(n*2)

- iterate 2d array
- get every pair of elements
- insertion sort

## O(n*m)
- 2d array that is not square

## O(n*3)

## O(logn)
- binary search
