#### **Additional Functionalities**

  - Validate user input on forms and provide helpful error messages.

- **State Management**:

  - Use React's Context API or state management libraries like Redux if necessary.
  - Manage loading states while fetching data from the API.

### **Component Structure Suggestion**

To organize your React application, consider breaking it down into reusable components:

- **Layout Components**:

  - `Navbar`
  - `Sidebar` (if needed)
  - `Footer`

- **Employee Components**:

  - `EmployeeList`
  - `EmployeeForm`
  - `EmployeeDetails`
  - `EmployeeItem` (for individual entries in lists)

- **Department Components**:

  - Similar structure to employees.

- **Position Components**:

  - Similar structure to employees.

- **Common Components**:
  - `SearchBar`
  - `FilterOptions`
  - `Modal`
  - `ConfirmationDialog`
  - `Notification` (for success/error messages)

---

### **Implementation Tips**

- **Routing**:

  - Use `react-router-dom` for handling client-side routing.
  - Define routes in a centralized `App` component.

- **API Integration**:

  - Use `axios` or the Fetch API to interact with your Strapi backend.
  - Create a service layer to abstract API calls.

- **TypeScript**:

  - Define interfaces/types for your data models (Employee, Department, Position).
  - Use types to enforce props validation in your components.

- **State Management**:

  - Start with React's built-in state and context.
  - Lift state up to parent components when necessary.

- **Styling**:

  - Choose a styling approach (CSS Modules, Styled Components, etc.).
  - Keep styles modular and component-specific.

### **Sample Data Models (TypeScript Interfaces)**

```typescript
// Employee.ts
export interface Employee {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  employeeId: string;
  department: Department;
  position: Position;
  contactInfo: ContactInfo;
}

export interface ContactInfo {
  email: string;
  phone: string;
}

// Department.ts
export interface Department {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
}

// Position.ts
export interface Position {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
}
```
